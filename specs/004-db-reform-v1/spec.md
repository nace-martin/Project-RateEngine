## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity and consistency across the pricing and quoting modules, so that I can prevent invalid data entries, improve performance, and provide accurate quotes to customers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new ratecard is created with an effective date that overlaps with an existing ratecard for the same provider, audience, and name, **When** the system attempts to save the new ratecard, **Then** the system MUST prevent the creation and raise an integrity error.
2. **Given** a new quote is created without specifying `is_incomplete` and `incomplete_reason`, **When** the system saves the quote, **Then** the `is_incomplete` flag MUST default to `FALSE` and `incomplete_reason` MUST be `NULL`.
3. **Given** a new quote is created with `is_incomplete` set to `TRUE` and `incomplete_reason` provided, **When** the system saves the quote, **Then** the `is_incomplete` flag MUST be `TRUE` and `incomplete_reason` MUST match the provided value.
4. **Given** a cartage ladder is defined with a weight band that overlaps with an existing cartage ladder for the same ratecard, **When** the system attempts to save the new cartage ladder, **Then** the system MUST prevent the creation and raise an integrity error.
5. **Given** a storage tier is defined with a week range that overlaps with an existing storage tier for the same ratecard and group code, **When** the system attempts to save the new storage tier, **Then** the system MUST prevent the creation and raise an integrity error.
6. **Given** a quote line is created, **When** the system saves the quote line, **Then** the `unit_price` column MUST have a precision of 4 decimal places and `extended_price` MUST have a precision of 2 decimal places.
7. **Given** a station is created with an IATA code, **When** the system saves the station, **Then** the IATA code MUST be converted to uppercase and its length MUST be exactly 3 characters.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user attempts to create a ratecard with an `expiry_date` that is earlier than its `effective_date`? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this be prevented by the system or handled by business logic?]
- How does the system handle existing data that violates the new constraints (e.g., overlapping ratecards) during migration? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The migrations are designed to be idempotent, but what is the expected behavior for existing invalid data?]
- What is the impact on performance for JSON filters after adding GIN indexes? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there specific performance targets for JSON queries?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST enforce unique currency codes and unit codes.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST establish foreign key relationships for currencies and units in `quotes` and `quote_lines` tables.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST add an `audience_id` column to `organizations` and `pricing_policy` tables.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST backfill `audience_id` in `organizations` and `pricing_policy` tables based on existing `audience` text codes.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST enforce foreign key relationships for `audience_id` in `organizations` and `pricing_policy` tables, referencing the `audiences` table.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST prevent overlapping effective date windows for ratecards with the same provider, audience, and name.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST prevent overlapping weight bands for cartage ladders within the same ratecard.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST prevent overlapping week ranges for storage tiers within the same ratecard and group code.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST add a `side` column to `quote_lines` with a default value of 'SELL' and a check constraint for 'BUY' or 'SELL'.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST ensure `unit_price` in `quote_lines` has a numeric precision of (18,4) and `extended_price` has a numeric precision of (18,2).
- **FR-011**: The system MUST migrate existing `is_buy`/`is_sell` flags in `quote_lines` to the new `side` column.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST add `is_incomplete` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE) and `incomplete_reason` (TEXT) columns to the `quotes` table.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST create GIN indexes on `quotes.request_snapshot`, `ratecard_fees.applies_if`, and `service_items.conditions_json` for faster JSON filtering.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST add check constraints to `ratecard_fees.applies_if` and `service_items.conditions_json` to ensure the presence of a 'kind' key.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST enforce a unique constraint on `route_id` and `sequence` in the `route_legs` table.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST establish foreign key relationships for currency in `ratecard_fees` and `service_items` tables.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST enforce that `iata` codes in the `stations` table are 3 characters long and uppercase.
