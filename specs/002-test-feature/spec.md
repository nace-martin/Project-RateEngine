# Feature Specification: AIR ¬∑ Import ¬∑ A2D (Airport‚ÜíDoor) v2 rating policy ‚Äî PREPAID & COLLECT

**Feature Branch**: `002-test-feature`  
**Created**: Monday 22 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Title: AIR ¬∑ Import ¬∑ A2D (Airport‚ÜíDoor) v2 rating policy ‚Äî PREPAID & COLLECT Goal - Make currency + fee selection 100% deterministic for AIR imports on A2D lanes (e.g., AU‚ÜíPG). - Remove ambiguity so quotes are consistent and auditable, regardless of rate-card coverage. Business Outcomes - Sales sees only the correct destination service menu for A2D imports. - Invoices land in the right currency: AUD for PREPAID importers, PGK for COLLECT importers. - No 500s or silent fallbacks; when data is missing, we return a clear, actionable reason. Scope (this spec only) - Mode: AIR - Direction: Import (origin outside destination country) - Scope: A2D (Airport‚ÜíDoor) - Payment Terms: PREPAID, COLLECT - Commodity: General Cargo (GCR) Rules (must-haves) 1) Audience & invoice currency - PREPAID (shipper pays): invoice currency = ORIGIN country currency (e.g., AU‚ÜíPG ‚Üí AUD). - COLLECT (consignee pays): invoice currency = DESTINATION country currency (e.g., AU‚ÜíPG ‚Üí PGK). - Audience is derived from payment term and direction; no UI toggle required. 2) Fee menu (A2D import) - Include only DESTINATION-side services: e.g., customs clearance, international terminal/handling, delivery/cartage, delivery fuel/x-ray where applicable. - Exclude ORIGIN-side services (pickup, export docs, origin x-ray, origin fuel) for A2D imports. - If a fee requires a base (e.g., ‚Äúpercent-of‚Äù another service) and the base isn‚Äôt present, skip that fee and record a warning in the snapshot. 3) Missing rate handling - If a BUY lane or required break is missing, mark the quote `is_incomplete = true` and add a ‚ÄúManual Rate Required‚Äù line with a reason. - Still compute sell totals from any available policy-driven items; never crash. 4) Totals & reporting - Response includes `totals.invoice_ccy`. - Provide itemized sell lines with stable `code` identifiers and currencies aligned to the invoice currency. - Provide a machine-readable `snapshot` describing which policy/recipe decided the lines. Inputs (examples) - Example A (PREPAID): BNE ‚Üí POM, A2D, pieces=[{weight_kg:81}] - Expected `totals.invoice_ccy = "AUD"` - Sell lines: dest-side menu only. - Example B (COLLECT): BNE ‚Üí POM, A2D, pieces=[{weight_kg:81}] - Expected `totals.invoice_ccy = "PGK"` - Sell lines: dest-side menu only. Acceptance Criteria - Given PREPAID A2D import, engine returns invoice_ccy=origin currency and only dest-side services. - Given COLLECT A2D import, engine returns invoice_ccy=destination currency and only dest-side services. - When ‚Äúpercent-of‚Äù base is absent, the dependent line is skipped and snapshot records why. - When BUY data is missing, engine returns `is_incomplete=true` with a clear reason but no server error. - Golden tests cover both PREPAID and COLLECT for at least AU‚ÜíPG lanes. Non-Goals (out of scope now) - Door pickup, export clearance, or other scopes (D2A, A2A, D2D). - Address book or email generation. - UI work beyond minimal fields required to call the endpoint. Why this matters - Locks core policy so sales quotes are correct by default. - Prevents regressions as we add more scopes, terms, and markets."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Rate Engine, I want currency and fee selection to be 100% deterministic for AIR imports on A2D lanes, so that quotes are consistent, auditable, and accurate regardless of rate-card coverage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** PREPAID A2D import, **When** the engine processes the quote, **Then** it returns `invoice_ccy=origin currency` and only destination-side services.
2. **Given** COLLECT A2D import, **When** the engine processes the quote, **Then** it returns `invoice_ccy=destination currency` and only destination-side services.
3. **Given** a fee requires a base and the base is absent, **When** the engine processes the quote, **Then** the dependent line is skipped and the snapshot records why.
4. **Given** BUY data is missing, **When** the engine processes the quote, **Then** it returns `is_incomplete=true` with a clear reason but no server error.
5. **Given** golden tests, **When** they are run, **Then** they cover both PREPAID and COLLECT for at least AU‚ÜíPG lanes.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a fee requires a base and the base isn't present?
- What happens when BUY data (lane or required break) is missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST ensure that for PREPAID (shipper pays) AIR Import A2D quotes, the invoice currency is the ORIGIN country currency (e.g., AU‚ÜíPG ‚Üí AUD).
- **FR-002**: The system MUST ensure that for COLLECT (consignee pays) AIR Import A2D quotes, the invoice currency is the DESTINATION country currency (e.g., AU‚ÜíPG ‚Üí PGK).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST derive the Audience from the payment term and direction, without requiring a UI toggle.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST include only DESTINATION-side services (e.g., customs clearance, international terminal/handling, delivery/cartage, delivery fuel/x-ray where applicable) in the fee menu for A2D imports.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST exclude ORIGIN-side services (pickup, export docs, origin x-ray, origin fuel) from the fee menu for A2D imports.
- **FR-006**: If a fee requires a base (e.g., "percent-of" another service) and the base isn't present, the system MUST skip that fee and record a warning in the snapshot.
- **FR-007**: If a BUY lane or required break is missing, the system MUST mark the quote `is_incomplete = true` and add a "Manual Rate Required" line with a reason.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST still compute sell totals from any available policy-driven items, even if BUY data is missing, and never crash.
- **FR-009**: The response MUST include `totals.invoice_ccy`.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide itemized sell lines with stable `code` identifiers and currencies aligned to the invoice currency.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST provide a machine-readable `snapshot` describing which policy/recipe decided the lines.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Quote**: Represents the overall quote request and its computed results.
- **Snapshot**: Detailed output of a rating calculation, including policy/recipe decisions.
- **Fee**: Represents a service charge, potentially with dependencies on other services.
