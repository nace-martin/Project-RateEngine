# Feature Specification: RateEngine v2 ‚Äî Simple Rating Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-rateengine-v2`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Title: RateEngine v2 ‚Äî Simple Rating Core (normalize ‚Üí rate_buy ‚Üí map_to_sell ‚Üí tax_fx_round) Problem Current compute_quote is hard to reason about (incoterms/payment/scope branches everywhere). We need a deterministic, auditable core with minimal branching that new devs can read in one sitting. Goals (What & Why) - Replace monolith with 4 pure functions: normalize, rate_buy, map_to_sell, tax_fx_round. - Drive 60% of decisions from two tiny tables (AUDIENCE, INVOICE_CCY) and a SellRecipe per (scope,audience). - Keep Incoterms as a clamp (who pays which segment), never a price mutator. - Emit a rich snapshot with {policy_key, policy_version} (code policy v1 for now). - Preserve current math: piecewise chargeable (ceil), cheapest break w/ MIN, CAF+FX direction, GST on a single segment, final SELL rounding. In Scope (MVP) - AIR only. Scopes: A2A, A2D, D2A, D2D. PNG routing via POM + domestic bridge. - Payment terms: PREPAID, COLLECT ‚áí audience & invoice ccy via tiny tables. - BUY: lanes+breaks+fees (existing models), pick cheapest after FX normalize. - SELL: recipe executor supporting pass_through, cost_plus_pct, cost_plus_abs, fixed. - Snapshot includes golden inputs & chosen breaks/fees, CAF/FX pairs, rounding notes. Out of Scope (MVP) - New DB policy models (we‚Äôll add versioned policies next phase). - Email sending; contact resolution (exists elsewhere). Acceptance - Given representative fixtures, v2 matches v1 totals on happy paths and is clearer to reason about. - Manual paths: if any leg missing or SPECIAL commodity/urgent ‚Üí single manual result with crisp reasons (no partial pricing). - Unit tests: 10 golden cases covering imports/exports/domestic, MIN vs break, CAF direction, GST, rounding, bridge/no-bridge."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Rate Engine, I want to compute a quote and have it be deterministic, auditable, and easy to understand, so that I can trust the pricing and new developers can easily maintain the system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a set of representative fixtures, **When** the v2 rating core is run, **Then** the calculated totals must match the v1 totals on happy paths.
2. **Given** a quote request where any leg is missing, **When** the rating core is run, **Then** a single manual result with a clear reason is returned.
3. **Given** a quote request with a SPECIAL commodity or marked as urgent, **When** the rating core is run, **Then** a single manual result with a clear reason is returned.
4. **Given** a quote request, **When** the rating core is run, **Then** a rich snapshot is emitted with `policy_key`, `policy_version`, golden inputs, chosen breaks/fees, CAF/FX pairs, and rounding notes.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a leg is missing from a quote request?
- What happens when a quote request is for a SPECIAL commodity?
- What happens when a quote request is marked as urgent?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST replace the monolithic `compute_quote` function with four pure functions: `normalize`, `rate_buy`, `map_to_sell`, and `tax_fx_round`.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST drive decisions from `AUDIENCE` and `INVOICE_CCY` tables and a `SellRecipe` per (scope, audience).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST use Incoterms as a clamp to determine who pays for which segment, not as a price mutator.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST emit a rich snapshot with `{policy_key, policy_version}`.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST preserve the current math for piecewise chargeable weight (ceiling), cheapest break with MIN, CAF+FX direction, GST on a single segment, and final SELL rounding.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST support AIR only for the MVP.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support scopes: A2A, A2D, D2A, D2D.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST support PNG routing via POM + domestic bridge.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST determine audience and invoice currency from payment terms (PREPAID, COLLECT) via tables.
- **FR-010**: The BUY logic MUST use existing models for lanes, breaks, and fees, and pick the cheapest after FX normalization.
- **FR-011**: The SELL logic MUST be a recipe executor supporting `pass_through`, `cost_plus_pct`, `cost_plus_abs`, and `fixed`.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST produce a single manual result with clear reasons if any leg is missing or the commodity is SPECIAL or urgent.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST have unit tests for 10 golden cases covering imports/exports/domestic, MIN vs break, CAF direction, GST, rounding, and bridge/no-bridge.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AUDIENCE**: [Represents the party being quoted, e.g., Shipper, Consignee]
- **INVOICE_CCY**: [Represents the currency of the invoice]
- **SellRecipe**: [Represents the rules for calculating the sell price based on scope and audience]
- **Snapshot**: [Represents the detailed output of a rating calculation]
