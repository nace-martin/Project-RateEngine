## ## Getting Started

To get the project running on your local machine, you will need two separate terminals.

### **Prerequisites**

* [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

### **Terminal 1: Run the Backend Server**

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
