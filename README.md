# Project-RateEngine 
Of course. A good `README.md` is the front door to your project. It should be clear, concise, and tell anyone who visits (including your future self) exactly what the project is and how to get it running.

Here is a professional `README.md` draft for your RateEngine project. You can copy and paste this directly into the `README.md` file in the root of your repository.

* **Backend:** Python with **Django** & **Django REST Framework**
* **Frontend:** JavaScript with **Next.js (React)** & **TypeScript**
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**
* **Database:** **SQLite** (for development), **PostgreSQL** (for production)

## ## Getting Started

To get the project running on your local machine, you will need two separate terminals.

### **Prerequisites**

* [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

### **Terminal 1: Run the Backend Server**

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Run the database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4.  **Start the Django server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    > The backend API will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The admin panel is at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.

### **Terminal 2: Run the Frontend Server**

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (only needed the first time):**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Next.js server:**
