# RateEngine ‚Äì Quoting Flow

This document defines the decision logic and quoting flows for **Air Freight scenarios** in RateEngine, with PNG-specific operational rules. It is intended for product managers and developers to align on business logic, scope constraints, and implementation details.

## 1. Shipment Type ‚Üí Routing Logic

All shipments must be classified as **Import**, **Export**, or **Domestic**. Each type determines the routing path and which legs to include.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Shipment Type?}
    B -->|Import (INTL ‚Üí PNG)| I1[Gateway: POM (Jacksons Int'l) ONLY]
    B -->|Export (PNG ‚Üí INTL)| E1[Gateway: POM (Jacksons Int'l) ONLY]
    B -->|Domestic (PNG ‚Üî PNG)| D1[Domestic Routing]

    %% IMPORT
    I1 --> I2[Customs Clearance at POM]
    I2 --> I3{Final Delivery Location = POM?}
    I3 -->|Yes| I4[Finish at POM: Airport‚ÜíDoor or Airport‚ÜíAirport per Scope]
    I3 -->|No (e.g., LAE / Outer Port)| I5[Add Domestic Onforwarding Leg: POM ‚Üí Final Port]
    I5 --> I6{Final Port = LAE?}
    I6 -->|Yes (LAE)| I7[Domestic Service: Door‚ÜîDoor available]
    I6 -->|No (HGU/RAB/HKN/MAG/WWK...)| I8[Domestic Service: Door‚ÜîAirport only]
    I7 --> I9[Deliver/Complete]
    I8 --> I9[Deliver/Complete]

    %% EXPORT
    E1 --> E2{Origin Location = POM?}
    E2 -->|Yes| E3[Uplift from POM to Final INTL Destination]
    E2 -->|No (Outer Port)| E4[Add Domestic Pre-Carriage: Origin Port ‚Üí POM]
    E4 --> E3
    E3 --> E5[Deliver/Complete]

    %% DOMESTIC
    D1 --> D2{Route = POM ‚Üî LAE?}
    D2 -->|Yes| D3[Door‚ÜîDoor allowed]
    D2 -->|No (Outer Ports)| D4[Only Door‚ÜíAirport or Airport‚ÜíDoor]
    D3 --> D5[Deliver/Complete]
    D4 --> D5[Deliver/Complete]
```

**Key PNG Rules:**
- All Imports and Exports *must* pass through **POM**.
- **Domestic POM‚ÜîLAE**: Door‚ÜîDoor possible.
- **Domestic Outer Ports**: Door‚ÜíAirport or Airport‚ÜíDoor only.

## 2. Service Scope ‚Üí Leg Builder

Defines how legs are built once shipment type/routing is known.

```mermaid

    S[Select Service Scope] --> C{Scope?}

    C -->|Door‚ÜíDoor| L1[Legs:
      1) Origin Pickup
      2) Main Air Leg
      3) Customs (as needed)
      4) Final Delivery]
    C -->|Door‚ÜíAirport| L2[Legs:
      1) Origin Pickup
      2) Main Air Leg
      3) Destination Airport Handover]
    C -->|Airport‚ÜíAirport| L3[Legs:
      1) Origin Airport Handover
      2) Main Air Leg
      3) Destination Airport Handover]
    C -->|Airport‚ÜíDoor| L4[Legs:
      1) Main Air Leg
      2) Customs (as needed)
      3) Final Delivery]

    %% PNG onforwarding insert
    L1 --> R{Does routing require POM onforwarding?}
    L2 --> R
    L3 --> R
    L4 --> R

    R -->|No| Q[Quote Summary Build]
    R -->|Yes| X[Insert Domestic Leg(s):
        - Import: POM ‚Üí Final Port
        - Export: Origin Port ‚Üí POM]
    X --> Q
    Q --> Z[Output: Price + Surcharges + Terms]
```

## 3. Example Sequence (Import: BNE ‚Üí LAE, Door‚ÜíDoor)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Sales Rep
    participant Q as Quoting Engine
    S->>Q: Shipment Type = Import
    Q->>Q: Route via POM (gateway)
    S->>Q: Scope = Door‚ÜíDoor
    Q->>Q: Build Legs:
    Note over Q: BNE Pickup ‚Üí BNE‚ÜíPOM Air ‚Üí POM Clearance ‚Üí POM‚ÜíLAE Domestic ‚Üí LAE Delivery
    Q->>Q: Apply PNG Rule: LAE supports Door‚ÜíDoor ‚úÖ
    Q->>Q: Calculate CW, base rate, surcharges (FAF, CAF, security), domestic leg rates
    Q->>S: Quote Summary (payer, Incoterms, totals, validity)
```

## 4. Quoting Scenarios Matrix


| **Dimension** | **Options / Variables** | **Business Logic / Impact on Quote** | **Notes for Developers (PNG-specific)** |
|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Shipment Type** | - Import (INTL ‚Üí PNG)<br>- Export (PNG ‚Üí INTL)<br>- Domestic (PNG ‚Üî PNG) | Defines routing logic, gateways, and which departments own the shipment. | Must apply different business rules for Imports vs Exports vs Domestic. |
| **Gateway / Routing** | - **Imports:** All cargo via POM (Jacksons Int‚Äôl) ‚Üí cleared ‚Üí domestic onforwarding if required.<br>- **Exports:** All cargo via POM (Jacksons Int‚Äôl) ‚Üí uplift.<br>- **Domestic:** POM ‚Üî LAE = full door-to-door possible. Other ports (HGU, RAB, HKN, MAG, WWK, etc.) = only door-to-airport or airport-to-door. | Determines whether a domestic leg must be added after international clearance, or before export uplift. | Hardcode POM as mandatory gateway for all INTL shipments. Build conditional logic for LAE vs ‚Äúouter-port‚Äù domestic service levels. |
| **Service Scope** | - Door ‚Üí Door<br>- Door ‚Üí Airport<br>- Airport ‚Üí Airport<br>- Airport ‚Üí Door | Same as before, but constrained by shipment type + gateway rules. | Example: Import BNE ‚Üí LAE Door ‚Üí Door = (Origin pickup) + (BNE‚ÄìPOM air leg) + (POM clearance) + (POM‚ÄìLAE domestic leg) + (LAE delivery). |
| **Payment Terms** | Prepaid / Collect | Defines who is invoiced (shipper or consignee). | Must reflect correctly in system invoices. |
| **Incoterms** | EXW, FOB, CPT, DDP, etc. | Defines which party pays which leg. | Tie directly to scope and payment terms. |
| **Cargo Type** | General, DG, Perishables, Live Animals, AOG, High-Value, Restricted | Adds airline restrictions, surcharges, and handling rules. | Rate logic must check eligibility of each cargo type against airline/domestic carriers. |
| **Commodity / HS Code** | Commodity description, HS code (if available) | Impacts Customs, permits (NAQIA, Quarantine). | Customs module integration needed. |
| **Weight & Volume** | Actual vs Volumetric; Chargeable = max | Determines air freight charges and breakpoints. | Must handle CW consistently across INTL + DOM legs. |
| **Client Requirements** | Transit time, carrier preference, insurance, consolidation/direct | Alters carrier/routing choice. | Allow optional toggles. |
| **Surcharges** | Fuel, CAF, Security, War Risk, Peak season | Applied to INTL leg. | Add separate surcharge sets for international vs domestic carriers. |
| **Market Constraints** | Airline capacity, seasonal embargoes | Impacts availability. | Fallback to manual/agent rate. |

## Developer Acceptance Criteria


- **Routing Rules:** All INTL shipments must pass through POM, with conditional domestic legs added for non-POM delivery/origin.
- **Service Scope:** Quote builder must dynamically add or exclude legs depending on Door/Airport selection.
- **Domestic Limits:** Door‚ÜîDoor allowed only for POM‚ÜîLAE. Other ports restricted.
- **Chargeable Weight Engine:** Always apply CW = max(Actual vs Volumetric) across all legs.
- **Fallback Handling:** If rate not found (DG restrictions, outer-port limits, etc.), system should trigger Agent Rate Request flow.
- **Logging:** Each quote must record selected Shipment Type, Scope, Incoterm, and Legs for audit and reporting.
